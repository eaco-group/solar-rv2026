One-Pager for Investors: Solar Energy Storage + Shared RV Ecosystem
Project Overview

We are building an innovative Solar + Energy Storage solution integrated with Shared Solar RVs to create a global mobile energy, living, and liquidity ecosystem. This ecosystem targets both sustainable energy solutions and the global cross-border community, particularly overseas Chinese and mobile living users.

Key Components

Solar + Energy Storage

Modular Solar Panels for energy generation.

Energy Storage Systems to store and distribute power efficiently.

Decentralized infrastructure aimed at empowering remote and mobile living.

Shared Solar RVs (Solar RVs)

RVs equipped with solar panels and battery storage.

Provides a mobile, self-sustaining living space for long-term travelers.

Integrates energy solutions for remote, off-grid living.

Digital Assets for Settlement (eCNH / A7A5)

Digital currency based on eCNH (a stablecoin backed by CNH).

Cross-border settlement system for global trade, especially in energy & travel.

Fiat on/off ramps for seamless integration with global financial systems.

SDK & Open Ecosystem

Open-source SDK for developers to create applications.

API integration with cross-border trading, finance, and mobility systems.

Funding Requirements

Phase 1 Funding Goal: ¥300M (approx. $45M USD)

Phase 2 Funding Goal: Up to ¥3B (approx. $450M USD)

Target Valuation: Path to a $10B–$100B market cap over the next 5–10 years.

Revenue Model

Solar RV Leasing: Renting out Solar RVs to individuals, companies, and institutions.

Energy Storage Solutions: Providing energy storage as a service to communities and businesses.

Cross-Border Settlement Fees: Transaction fees from the use of digital assets (eCNH) in cross-border settlements.

Mobile Infrastructure Partnerships: Strategic partnerships with cities and countries for infrastructure deployments.

Competitive Advantages

Sustainability: Solar-powered, off-grid solutions for energy independence.

Mobility: Seamless integration of energy, living, and mobility.

Digital Integration: Cross-border payments using digital assets (eCNH).

Scalability: Ability to scale globally, starting with strategic partnerships in overseas Chinese communities, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other high-demand markets.

Long-Term Vision

To create a decentralized, self-sustaining ecosystem where energy is seamlessly integrated with living and financial systems. We aim to position ourselves at the forefront of smart energy solutions, mobile living, and digital asset-based economies.

Next Steps
